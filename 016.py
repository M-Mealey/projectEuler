Project Euler Problem 16
========================

2^15 = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26.

What is the sum of the digits of the number 2^1000?
"""

# The naive way to do this is to calculate 2^1000 and iterate over its digits, adding them together
x = 2**1000
sum = 0
while x > 0:
    sum += x%10
    x = x//10
