"""
Project Euler Problem 46
========================

It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can
be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

9 = 7 + 2 * 1^2
15 = 7 + 2 * 2^2
21 = 3 + 2 * 3^2
25 = 7 + 2 * 3^2
27 = 19 + 2 * 2^2
33 = 31 + 2 * 1^2

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a
prime and twice a square?
