Project Euler Problem 15
========================

Starting in the top left corner of a 2 * 2 grid, there are 6 routes
(without backtracking) to the bottom right corner.

How many routes are there through a 20 * 20 grid?

"""
Each step is either in the +x or +y direction, 
so for a 20x20 grid every path will consist of exactly 40 steps
The total number of paths is therefore the number of ways you can arrange the 20 +x steps
within the list of 40 total steps (with the rest of the steps being +y)
It's equivalent to figuring out how many ways you can flip a coin 40 times and end up with
20 heads and 20 tails
Mathematically, this can be calculated as nCr, where n=40 and r=20
